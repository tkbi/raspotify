Additional description on, how to get Raspotiy running on the C.H.I.P from nexctthing, which is
a very small computer /  IoT,  like Rasberry PI, but just for 9,00$ quick (from https://getchip.com/) :-)



First of all, I have to say many thanks to ctcooper, he did a real good job for the raspberry PI, so we can 
use it like a fork from the github side:

    https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify

Take care to follow the instruction in that following way, it did works for me successfully!


First add the key.asc from github/ctcooper, don't start the install script from this side, it's
working only for Raspberry PI

But because we have DEBIAN Jessie on C.H.I.P running, we can use a part of it !

    wget https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/key.asc

than add the key of the repository from ctcooper to your apt
    sudo apt-key add key.asc

Next step is to generate the raspotify.list file in the sources.list.d of apt.

Add a new list to your apt sources

    md /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspotify.list
    sudo nano raspotify.list

and put in that file the followed entry, just one line :-)

    deb https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify jessie main

that's it's, so far, the preparing.

Now just run 
    sudo apt-get update

and next
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https lsb-release
    sudo apt-get -y install raspotify

restart is not needed, just wait a minute or so, and take a look at your smartphone, running spotify
as you may know in the APP for Spotify, it is possible to connect to any running client (raspotify, snapclient etc.) 
and you can connect to enjoy your music in every room, where you have a CHIP running and connected with the 3,5 mm jack to your
HiFi-equipment, or just a JBL box :-)
